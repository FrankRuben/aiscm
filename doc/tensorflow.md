# Tensorflow bindings
## Basic XOR example

The following example demonstrates the *Tensorflow* bindings using the XOR function as example.
The input *features* and the desired output *labels* are provided using placeholder values.
The network is trained using gradient descent.
Finally the network is demonstrated using the input features.
