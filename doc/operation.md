# Array operations
## Unary operations

THe unary operations are:

* **-**: negation
* **~**: bitwise not
* **=0**: (or **!**): check equal to zero
* **!=0**: test not zero

Here are a few examples using those operations:

```Scheme
@../tests/integration/unary_ops.scm@
```

Applied to the following image ...

... inverting the RGB values yields the following image:

![](inverted.jpg "Inverted image")

```Scheme
@../tests/integration/invert.scm@
```
